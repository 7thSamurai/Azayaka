# Disassembler

Azayaka comes with a basic disassembler for debugging and reverse engineering Game Boy programs.

## Features

- Ability to use a Code/Data Log(CDL).
- When reading or writing to an IO register, automatically inserts a comment of the register's name.

## Warning

The disassembler is probably filled with a lot of bugs. I haven't worked on it and tested it much yet.

## Note

Currently the only way to use it is through the debugger, but I will add in the option to disassemble a ROM file sometime soon.
